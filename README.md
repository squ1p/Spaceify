# Spaceify

This is a quickly put together utility. It takes a folder, and tries to open eveyr text file in it.

It then turns every tab (\t) into 4 spaces, beacause IT'S THE LAW.

```
usage: spaceify.py [-h] -f FOLDER

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FOLDER, --folder FOLDER
                        Folder to search in
```
